            <p>
                Hello! My name is Jenni Eslinger. I live in Arizona. In another life, I was a legal assistant to a criminal defense attorney in the area. 
                I stopped working in law when my second daughter was born to focus on raising my family. I have 4 children now, 3 daughters and 1 boy. 
                As my children have gotten older I been trying to focus on what I want to do with my future. So far my path has led me here. 
                I have been interested in coding and web development for a while. I have enjoyed learning the new material and hope to continue to do so.
            </p>
