                <p>Hello! My name is Jenni Eslinger. I live in Arizona. In another life, I was a legal assistant to a criminal defense attorney in the area. I stopped working in law when my second daughter was born to focus on raising my family. I have 4 children now, 3 daughters and 1 boy. As my children have gotten older I've been trying to focus on what I want to do with my future. So far my path has led me here. I have been interested in coding and web development for a while. I have enjoyed learning the new material and hope to continue to do so.</p>

                <p>Arizona is where I call home. Once a Mexican territory, Arizona was founded in 1912. Arizona or the Grand Canyon State is in the southwest of the United States. It is known for it's hot desert climate, major sports teams, a lot of cactus, and colorful sunsets. Arizona is home to over 15 national parks and monuments including possibly the most famous and reason for the Arizona's nickmame, the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon is a expansive canyon carved over billions of years by the Colorado River. The Grand Canyon is 277 miles long, 18 miles across at it's widest location, and 1 mile deep. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt said "The Grand Canyon filles me with awe. It is beyond comparison- beyond description; absolutely unparalleled throughout the wide world... Let this great wonder of nature remain at it is now. Do nothing to mar its grandeur, sublimity and loveliness." Later, in 1908, President Roosevent declared the Grand Canyon a National Monument. -nps.gov/grca/index.htm-   </p>
